# Growing and Shrinking Square
This project features a dynamic square that grows and shrinks as you scroll up and down the webpage. It demonstrates basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Installation
1. Download the project files to your local machine.

## Copy code
1. git clone https://github.com/your-username/growing-shrinking-square.git
2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

## How to Use
1. Scroll up and down the webpage to observe the square's behavior.
2. When you scroll down, the square will gradually grow.
3. When you scroll up, the square will shrink.

## Code Overview
The JavaScript code in main.js performs the following actions:

1. It creates a div element representing the square and appends it to the body of the webpage.

2. The initial size of the square is set to 100 pixels.

3. An event listener is added to the window object to detect scroll events.

4. When scrolling down, the square will grow until it reaches half of the window's width.

5. When scrolling up, the square will shrink until its size is zero.

This project serves as a simple example of how to manipulate the DOM in response to user interactions.
